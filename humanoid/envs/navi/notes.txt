_resample_commands() legged_robot.py, potentially needed for RL? appears in various places
rigid_states?
num_agent = 19 or 20?
terrain-height - for obs 
ORCA frequency?

TODO:
    Experiments:
        -Baseline ORCA (limit observation?)
        -Baseline end-to-end training by reward tuning
        -Abalation with HRL and Group

    MUST:
        -Human URDF
        -Group Based Representation
        -HRL framework
        -Pedsim Visualization X

    Maybe:
        -Replay data
        -ORCA mod
